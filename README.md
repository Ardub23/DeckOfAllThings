# The Deck of All Things
The Deck of All Things is a browser-based tool to create, customize, and draw from your own Deck of Many Things for *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* Fifth Edition.

You can quickly draw from a deck of 13 or 22 cards, or from an expanded deck with 50 additional homebrew cards. You can also adjust the number of cards you'd like to draw.

## Deck customization

When customizing a deck, you can choose what kind of deck to start with. I recommend using the default (full deck plus homebrew cards).

You might want to exclude the more disruptive cards from a deck, or devise a "cursed" deck that seems to produce only unpleasant cards. To allow this, every single card has been rated in terms of *wildness* and *worth*. (Both ratings are, of course, subjective.)

* **Wildness** measures how likely a card is to disrupt a campaign. This generally corresponds to how powerful the effects are.
* **Worth** measures how desirable a card is; cards of middling worth include those with effects that are neither good nor bad, as well as cards whose benefits come with a drawback or caveat.

You can choose whether some cards or others are fitting for your deck based on these. Enable the advanced options to see exactly how the sliders work.

By default, the more unfitting a card is, the less likely it is to be in the deck. (Don't worry&mdash;there are enough homebrew cards that you'll likely still have a good variety.) If you choose, you can make that probability instead be the relative likelihood for cards to be drawn; every card is in the deck, but unfitting cards are rarely seen.

You can also choose how to deal with specific types of cards that may be undesirable. Not everyone wants to worry about XP or alignment, so I've created alternate effects for cards that use these. If you prefer to write your own replacements (or just remove these cards), you can do this when editing individual cards.

Lastly, a quirk of the Deck of Many Things (which I didn't know about until this project) is that it's possible to draw the same card more than once. A drawn card disappears and (in most cases) reappears with the other cards in the deck. If you to be certain you won't draw the same card more than once, there's an option for that.

## Card customization

After setting deck customization parameters (or importing a deck), you have the option to customize the individual cards. Edit the name, description, and other attributes to your heart's content.

To "skip" straight to card customization, just choose which card sources to use in the deck customization options, and ignore the other settings.

## Exporting and importing

During card customization or drawing, you can export the active deck to your clipboard. Paste it in a text file to save for later, send it to a friend, whatever.

To import a deck, click the 'Start over' button after drawing, or refresh the page, then click 'Import deck'.
